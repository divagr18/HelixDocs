# Helix

Helix is an innovative platform designed to transform the way engineering teams interact with their codebase. Built on a high-performance Rust engine, Helix parses your entire codebase into a verifiable Merkle-hashed graph, enabling deep code understanding. 

Helix generates living documentation, surfaces architectural insights, and connects code to its runtime behavior. Refactor with confidence, generate and execute test cases, explore dependencies visually, and onboard faster with AI-powered explanations.

**Import from GitHub or upload local projects.** Helix automatically analyzes your code structure, detects all classes and functions, and maps dependencies between components. Get instant metrics like cyclomatic complexity and maintainability scores.

**Auto-generate documentation at every level.** Generate repository-level READMEs, module-level documentation, and function-level docstrings across your entire codebase. Keep documentation synchronized with code changes and revive outdated docs with AI assistance.

**Generate tests and refactoring recommendations.** Automatically create comprehensive test cases for untested code. Get intelligent refactoring suggestions based on complexity analysis and code patterns. Improve code quality with actionable recommendations.

**AI-powered code exploration.** Press **Ctrl+K** to chat with an intelligent assistant that understands your codebase. Ask questions, explore architecture, and get instant answers using vector search across your entire project.

**Complete privacy guaranteed.** Built with Django, React, and Rust, Helix runs entirely on your infrastructure with Docker. Your code never leaves your machine.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (20.10+) and Docker Compose (v2+)
- Git
- GitHub account (for OAuth authentication)



## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divagr18/Helix.git
cd Helix
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure these required variables:

```env
# Django
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-generate-random-string
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Database
POSTGRES_DB=helix_db
POSTGRES_USER=helix_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# GitHub OAuth (Required for adding GitHub repos)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 3. Set Up GitHub OAuth

Create a GitHub OAuth App:

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Configure:
   - Application name: Helix
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:8000/accounts/github/callback/`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts all services:
- Backend (Django): http://localhost:8000
- Frontend (React): http://localhost:5173
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Celery workers for background tasks

**Note:** On first startup, GitHub OAuth will be automatically configured from your environment variables. If you see OAuth errors, restart the backend container after adding your credentials.

### 5. Access the Application

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and click "Continue with GitHub" to authenticate, or make a local account for local repo only usage.

### Technology Stack

Backend: Django 5.2.3, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, Celery

Engine: Rust

Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui

Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose

## Usage

### GitHub Repository Analysis

1. Login with your GitHub account
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Click "Import from GitHub"
4. Enter repository URL or select from your repositories
5. Wait for analysis to complete
6. Explore Code, Intelligence, and Testing views

### Local Repository Upload

1. Navigate to "Upload Local Repository"
2. Select a folder (up to 500 files)
3. Optionally provide a repository name
4. Click "Upload and Analyze"
5. View results in the repository dashboard

### Interface Navigation

- **Dashboard**: Repository overview and workspace management
- **Code View**: File browser, metrics, and symbol navigation
- **Intelligence**: Dependency graphs and code relationships
- **Testing**: Test coverage information
- **Chat**: AI assistant with vector search for Q&A, documentation generation, test creation, and more (Press **Ctrl+K** to open from anywhere in a repository)


## Troubleshooting

### Docker

Containers fail to start:
```bash
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose restart
```

Port already in use:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5173
```

### Database

Connection refused:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

Migrations not applied:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

### GitHub OAuth

Redirect URI mismatch:
- Verify callback URL: `http://localhost:8000/accounts/github/callback/`
- Check `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in backend settings

OAuth app not configured:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py setup_github_oauth
docker-compose restart backend
```
